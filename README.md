Cocktail Recipe Generator is a fun and interactive web application that fetches random cocktail recipes using the TheCocktailDB API. 
The project demonstrates how to integrate a REST API into a web application, displaying cocktail details such as ingredients, instructions, and images. 
This project helped me learn how to work with REST APIs, handle API responses, and present data dynamically on the front-end.
